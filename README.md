# Project 0: Dodge the Creeps
A tutorial implementation by Caleb Van Lue.

This project follows the [Your First Game tutorial from
godotengine.org](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).

## Project Report
I found the most interesting and challenging portion of this project to be the command line Git integration. I'm sure that unlike most students in this course, I only had experience using Git through its integration with IntelliJ, which makes it very simple to commit and push to remote repositories. Learning to use Git through the command line has been a completely new experience for me. There was quite a learning curve, as I rarely use a command line in my daily work, but once I got the hang of it, I found it to be quite useful. This is likely something that I will continue using for my future work, as it is ubiquitous and can be used for all of my projects, whether the code editors have integration with Git or not. 

- [X] D-1: The repository link is submitted before the project deadline.
- [X] C-1: The tutorial has been completed.
- [X] B-1: Your <code>.gitignore</code> file is correctly specified in the repository.
- [X] A-1: The project report is complete as per the instructions.

I believe that I properly earn an A for this project.
